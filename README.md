# Dispatcher

This is the companion app to article on concurrency in iOS. 

- [Concurrency Visualized: Sync vs Async, Serial vs Concurrent (Coming soon!)](https://besher.ca)

<i>The app is optimized for iPhone X screen or larger, so I recommend not picking something smaller than an iPhone X simulator.</i>

The app has a 10-question quiz that tests your concurrency knowledge. I suggest trying it before and after reading the article to see how your score changes. 

There is also a visual explanation of synchronous and asynchronous execution, and serial and concurrent queues.
