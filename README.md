# Dispatcher

This is the companion app to my article on concurrency in iOS

[Concurrency Visualized: Sync vs Async, Serial vs Concurrent (Coming soon!)](https://besher.ca)


## How to Install

- Clone the repo and build locally in your Xcode
- [Or download the public beta directly on your device](https://testflight.apple.com/join/2tC0CKMO)


The app is optimized for iPhone X screen or larger, so I recommend not picking something smaller than an iPhone X simulator.

The app has a 10-question concurrency quiz. I suggest trying it before and then again after reading the article to see how your score changes 

There is also a visual explanation of synchronous and asynchronous execution, as well as serial and concurrent queues.
